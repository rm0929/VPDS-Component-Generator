# VPDS UI Generator

A single‑page React application inspired by Visa’s Product Design System (VPDS) that lets developers describe UI patterns in plain English and instantly:

- **Preview** a live Nova‑React component  
- **Copy** ready‑to‑use React/TypeScript code  
- **Switch** between light & dark themes

  Use the switch in the navbar to toggle between **light** and **dark** themes.

- **Responsive & accessible**  
  Built with Nova `Utility`, `Typography`, and a focus on WCAG‑compliant patterns.

## 🤖 AI Assistance

Throughout development I leaned on AI tools sparingly—mostly as a coding sidekick. I used it to:

- **Spot syntax errors** and suggest small bug‑fixes  
- **Brainstorm UI/UX ideas**, layouts and workflows  
- **Generate concise examples** and boilerplate snippets  

Everything core to the component logic, theming, and accessibility was hand‑crafted—AI only stepped in when it could save a few keystrokes or spark a fresh idea.
